# eGFR Calculator
My old project I started in 2012

This is a calculator for the absolute and relative eGFR (estimated Globular Filtration Rate) in humans.

Absolute eGFR is for determining the kidney function in patients before administering medicines,
in particular iodine and gadolinium based contrast mediums.

The project is in swedish.

This project is finished in this form and are here for archiving purposes only.

# Compilation
